# Portfolio Project 1.

## Due Date: 10/06/2020 worth 100 points

### The top of **EVERY** page you create and add code to must include the statement in the form of a comment “I affirm that I, (Your name here), have not given or received any unauthorized help on this assignment, and that this work is my own.” Failure to include this statement on any page will result in a zero for all work on that page

This project is broken into 8 parts. You will need to complete the parts in order for success. Follow the directions specifically. If you are unsure of expectations please ask me. If you ask another student you run the risk of both being wrong.

Part 1. As in almost every field, the job market for the best jobs in web development are competitive. One way to give yourself a big edge in a job search is to create an appropriate personal portfolio website to showcase your skills. First change the name of the word document to include your name. For example using my name the word document should be titled MichaelKelley_portfolio_plan.docx. Next complete the entire word document. I expect this to be a serious attempt at building a portfolio. Your answers may change over time to some of these questions as you learn new things, but I need to see serious consideration to each section of the word document. You can use drawing tools right in Word for the wireframe or you can use external software and import the wireframe image if you want to. While the majority of the site is up to you the sitemap must include 4 pages at minimum. 3 of which are required. Index, About Me, and Contact Me are the required pages. You must include at least 1 more page of your choice and if you feel you need more than one additional page at this time you may include it as well. Once the word documnet is complete be sure to upload it to GitHub with the rest of the project.

Part 2. Create a new word document called ProjectAnswers.docx. You will have a number of questions that you are required to answer at various times throughout this project. This document will be included within the project folder and will also be uploaded to GitHub for submission. Be sure to include the question with your response. If your response required research outside of the textbook you must include any references you used in the process. Failure to do so will result in a plagiarism violation. Your first question is: What do you want this website to accomplish?

Part 3. You have already created your website plan, wireframe, and sitemap. So now its time to start work on your site. Complete the following steps.
* [ ] Create a folder to serve as the root folder for the website and name the folder (YourName)Portfolio.
  * [ ] For example my folder would be labeled MichaelKelleyPortoflio.
* [ ] Create a webpage template with HTML semantic elements and static content.
* [ ] Save the template file within your portfolio folder.
* [ ] Add a multiline comment above the HTML element that includes your name, the file name, and the current date.
* [ ] Add a comment above the main element to note its purpose.
* [ ] In the header, include a heading element for your name, and then add another heading element with your mission statement or tagline.
* [ ] In the nav area, include text for the links you will provide to the other webpages in the website.
* [ ] Validate the template, correct any errors, and then use the template to create a home page and name it index.html for your portfolio.
* [ ] Finally, add content to the main content area on your index.html page.
  * [ ] Add at least 2 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text.
  * [ ] You can use a lorem ipsum generator to create this.
  * [ ] A quick good search should lead you to one.  
* [ ] Save your progress and pick up with part 5.

Part 4. Here is the next question for your ProjectAnswers.docx. How will you improve this website? Research other online portfolios for ideas on what you can add to enhance the look of your website.
